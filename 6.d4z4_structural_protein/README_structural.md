This folder contains everything related to the structural assessment of the CIC-DUX4 divergent 
fusion protein and how it would look like, comparing the fusion sequence frame to the 
cannonical proteins and DUX4 sequences (on chr4) by BLASTn and BLASTp. There is a Python script
where BioPython is used to assess the frame and how the protein would look. There are also 
output text files from BLASTn and BLASTp included in this folder.
