This directory contains information relating to the breakpoint reconstruction. 
Note that all directories are under the initial setup, casm/team274sb.
The process of extracting sequences for blat and blast starts in the pysam_sequence_blatting.ipynb script 
where soft clipped sequences from coordinates of interest are extracted using multiple functions
into a separata fasta folder containing fasta files per sequence with their read IDs. Then, there are blat and blast .sh 
scripts for the different tumor breakpoints of interest on chromosomes 1, 19 and 10 involved in the rearrangement. 
For chromosome 19, there are both a blat and blast script which are used further downstream the pysam Python script 
to assign breakpoints. For other chromosomes, the scripts are mostly illustrative. 

The pysam script also contains the extraction of soft clipped reads from the RNA sample which was processed analogously using
blat. 

Furthermore, there is a script for the pairwise D4Z4 sequance search by BLAST using the T2T reference. Downstream processing and
heatmap construction are included in the pysam_sequence_blatting.ipynb as well.
